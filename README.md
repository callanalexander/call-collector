# Call Clustering

This repository demonstrates a post-processing pipeline after birdsong classification. The aim of this pipeline is to annotate individual notes for the target species (in this case, we use _Ninox strenua_, the Powerful Owl). This is achieved by segmenting the audio outputs and extracting acoustic features and then iteratively clustering those features using UMAP and HDBSCAN.

This is the associated code for the paper Alexander, C., Clemens, R., Roe, P., & Fuller, S. Automated Note Annotation after Bioacoustic Classification: Unsupervised Clustering of Extracted Acoustic Features Improves Detection of a Cryptic Owl. Available at SSRN 5099945.

The pipeline can be used with the outputs of any birdsong detection model (e.g. BirdNET or Perch), all it requires is short .wav file snippets to work. However in this case we demonstrate it with a simple binary classifier to show how the process can also be used to identify false-positives and also facilitate semi-supervised learning. 

# **Call Cluster - Birdsong Classification and Clustering**

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks designed for analyzing and classifying birdsong using deep learning and clustering techniques.

- **`binaryclassifier.ipynb`** ‚Üí A deep learning-based classifier for detecting owl vocalizations from spectrograms.
- **`cluster_inspector.ipynb`** ‚Üí A clustering and visualization tool for analyzing detected calls and separating true owl vocalizations from false positives.

## **Setup Instructions (For Anaconda and Beginners)**

### **Step 1: Download and Install Anaconda**
If you don‚Äôt have Anaconda installed, **download and install it here**:  
[Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

---

### **Step 2: Download the Repository**
#### **Option 1: Using Git**
If you have Git installed, you can clone the repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/call_cluster.git
```

Then navigate into the folder:

```bash
cd call_cluster
```

#### **Option 2: Manually Download the Files**
If you **don‚Äôt** have Git installed:
1. Go to [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/call_cluster).
2. Click the green **‚ÄúCode‚Äù** button ‚Üí **‚ÄúDownload ZIP‚Äù**.
3. Extract the ZIP file on your computer.

---

### **Step 3: Open Anaconda Prompt**
- **Windows:** Search for ‚ÄúAnaconda Prompt‚Äù in the Start Menu and open it.  
- **Mac:** Open Terminal and type `conda` to check if Anaconda is installed.

---

### **Step 4: Navigate to the Project Folder**
Once you‚Äôve downloaded or cloned the repository, move into the project folder:

```bash
cd path/to/call_cluster
```

For example, if you extracted it into your **Documents** folder:

```bash
cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\call_cluster
```

---

### **Step 5: Create a New Conda Environment**
Now, create a new environment called `call_cluster`:

```bash
conda create -n call_cluster python=3.8
```

Then **activate the environment**:

```bash
conda activate call_cluster
```

---

### **Step 6: Install Required Packages**
#### **Option 1: Install Everything from `requirements.txt`**
If you've downloaded the `requirements.txt` file, install all dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

üí° **How to Find `requirements.txt`?**  
It is located **inside the project folder** (`call_cluster/`). If you‚Äôre unsure, check by running:

```bash
dir   # On Windows
ls    # On Mac
```

This should list the files, and you should see `requirements.txt`. If not, **make sure you're in the correct folder**.

#### **Option 2: Manually Install Packages**
If `requirements.txt` isn't working, install packages individually:

```bash
conda install tensorflow scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib pillow librosa soundfile sounddevice
pip install umap-learn hdbscan scikit-maad
```

---

### **Step 7: Install `tkinter` (For `cluster_inspector.ipynb`)**
`tkinter` is used in `cluster_inspector.ipynb` for UI elements.

- **Windows/macOS users:** `tkinter` is included with Python, so no extra steps.

If you **still get an error** when running `cluster_inspector.ipynb`, try installing it inside your conda environment:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge tk
```

---

### **Step 8: Run the Jupyter Notebooks**
Start Jupyter Notebook by running:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then:
- Open **`binaryclassifier.ipynb`** to run the deep learning classifier.
- Open **`cluster_inspector.ipynb`** to analyze and visualize clusters.

---

## **Troubleshooting**
üí° **Common Issues & Fixes**
1. **Jupyter Notebook Not Found?**  
   Install it with:
   ```bash
   conda install jupyter
   ```

2. **ImportError: No module named ‚Äòtkinter‚Äô**  
   Follow **Step 7** to install `tkinter`.

3. **Can‚Äôt Find `requirements.txt`?**  
   Run:
   ```bash
   dir  # Windows
   ls   # Mac
   ```
   Ensure you‚Äôre in the correct folder before installing dependencies.
